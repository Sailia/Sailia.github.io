Today we worked on some more shaders in Unity. We learned how to add glow elements to objects and turned the objects into holograms! I love how Unity can create awesome patterns just from any image. So I am able to download an image with a pattern and use it to manipulate objects. For example, I can use a pattern with varying levels of light to dark that can translate into levels of animation depending on the lightness or darkness of the image.

Iâ€™m excited to create more interesting scenes within our team.
