This morning we went over Craft of Research and what it means to initiate theory. Iâ€™m generally terrible at writing so when we had to suddenly apply these concepts to paper, my imposter syndrome popped up to say hi. I think this is something Iâ€™m going to learn to accept but just to be mindful of when it happens will help.

When we had a luncheon with Eliot Winer, his talk helped me be present rather than worry. He talked about his journey in figuring out what he wanted to do and all the weird situations that arose that determined his decisions. It is funny how we try to control our future as much as we can but to no avail and he definitely reminded us of that. I really enjoyed his talk because of the passion he exuded about his career and that is something I strive for.

We went to Ada Hayden park for a barbecue for some burgers. I was excited to have dinner after a long day but it was all pork! So I didnâ€™t get to eat dinner until I got home ðŸ˜¢ Frisbee was fun though
