Now, this is a story all about how
My bagel tried to burn the dorm down
And I’d like to take a minute
I’ll tell you where
How my roommates saw me wave my towel in the air

Thats all I got. So I woke everyone at 7am due to a minor mishap of my bagel being a little over toasted. I was frantically waving a towel at the fire alarm light, not the actual smoke detector. My roomies were very forgiving, thanks ya’ll.

It’s been such a strange day. I set the fire alarm off in my dorm, then later my partner told me he missed me setting the fire alarm off in the kitchen at home. Had multiple Deja Vu moments of seeing my mentors Heike and Ganesh, then with Emmanuelle and Tiger. Then after work I tied my hair up and Nina said I looked like Li Shang from Mulan…. I don’t know how to respond to her anymore…. Anyway, I later see this in my instagram feed:



I’m a Capricorn…

I’ve been going for walks after work to process the day. I walked to Fareway which is a grocery store in Ames. Its two miles away so in total I’ve walked 4 miles! The neighbourhoods are very manicured and it makes me feel a little weary of how perfect everything looks. All the homes are massive, clean and prim. Grass is one length. Not a piece of rubbish in sight. I was basically in “The Truman Show”. I keep forgetting I’m in Iowa when working at VRAC until I notice the surrounding area. Been born and raised in London, then moved to Chicago. Moving from the city life to Ames makes me question whether I’d be able to handle a lifestyle thats overly different from what I’m used to. Nothing’s right I’m torn….
