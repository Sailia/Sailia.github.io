Flight to Iowa

Flying in from Chicago to Ames was quite nerve wracking. There was so much that I was anticipating for the next few weeks from moving from a large city to a university town to wondering whether what I currently know will be of any use to the program. Once I met Abby Boytos and Andrew Zaman I felt at ease knowing that they would be our advisors. They’re really inspiring because they are graduate psychology students consistently looking to hone their craft but at the same time were humble and fun to hang out with. It made me consider becoming a grad student at Iowa State too!

Meeting Stephen Gilbert and Eliot Winer at the welcome dinner was an amazing experience. It was such a lovely welcome at Stephen’s home and to meet his two sons. Eliot and Stephen explained the research process and their expectations of us this summer. This further helped me settle in with ease knowing I’d be working alongside awesome professors at Iowa State.
