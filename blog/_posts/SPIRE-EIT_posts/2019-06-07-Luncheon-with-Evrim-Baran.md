Meeting Evrim Baran was really inspirational. She has PhD’s in Human Computer Interaction, and Curriculum and Instructional Technology. She has shared her expertise all over the world from Germany to Turkey and has written over 30 publications in the past 10 years. I was suprised to hear that she started coding in COBOL and Pascal at the age of 14. I want to be like her!

Emmanuelle, Tiger, and I went to CSafe to further understand where we stand on our next step 😉 We chose to write our problem statement and learned more about the OpenFMC library. We will need to figure out how to read in a binary file on C++ and have it converted into readable text instead of weird characters.

After that meeting I went for my appointment because I wasn’t feeling too well since last night and unfortunately had to miss game night 🙁 I got back to my dorm and knocked out. I woke up to have dinner and study. I’m glad Roselynn liked the chicken curry I made and finished it because I was all curried out.

Even though I wasn’t feeling great, my roommates helped me forget. They constantly crack me up. I love hanging out with them and am so lucky to be able to stay with them. 🙂
