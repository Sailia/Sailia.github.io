I came in extra early to get my ID card sorted out. Felt much better getting that done. We got to meet our faculty members and mentor. Susan VanderPlas is full of energy and Ganesh Krishnan is hilarious! When they explained more about the bullet scans and what they’re expecting of us, I became even more motivated to get started. We have yet to meet our other faculty mentor Heike Hofmann but looking I’m forward to it!

We had a lecture on what good research is about and it finally gave me a somewhat aha moment. Hopefully applying these concepts is as easy as understanding them.
