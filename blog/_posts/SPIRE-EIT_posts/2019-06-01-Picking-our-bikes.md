I got a free bike from helping Val organise her bike shop! I hadn’t ridden a bike in ten years and was nervous because we were to ride our bikes back to our apartments which is 2 miles away. But because I was with Nina, Tiger and Roselyn, I felt brave enough to ride with them. I haven’t begun my research but riding my bike with such an awesome team was already an accomplishment in itself. My butt hurts though.
