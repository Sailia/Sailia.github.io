In the morning we took the Myers Briggs assessment. My personality type is INTP which means I’m a “Logician”. Apparently I share the same personality type with the likes of Albert Einstein, Blaise Pascal and Isaac Newton. Please god let this be true.

The assessment was more about understanding our teamwork traits and to only take the results of this assessment with a grain of salt. If we utilise our strengths and explain our weaknesses to our teammates, it’d help with the flow of teamwork.

I’m so grateful to have my first VR experience at VRAC’s C6 because it is the world’s highest resolution, fully immersive virtual environment! It made me think of all the possibilities related to this technology and how to create impactful, ethical programs.
