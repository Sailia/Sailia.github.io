Today we delved into wonderful world of Maya. I loved working in Maya as its more intuitive and forgiving compared to the nitty gritty constraints from SolidWorks. Maya can allow for mistakes, but I think this is fine to just play around in especially for the fact that we will only be using it for two days. I made a cat which few people believed it to be either a kangaroo with swole legs or a chicken. I can’t even fathom how they conjured up these assumptions as the differences are so far apart, are but I appreciate their efforts.

It was nice getting to know Kate. I was gobsmacked when she told me that shes an undergrad because she taught the class like a pro. We bonded over our cats as we both like our furry introverts. She just adopted a kitten two weeks ago. Her name is Papaya because of Kate’s long struggle of trying to eat one. Can confirm she hasn’t been able to munch on one just yet. But Papaya (her kitten) is a good replacement for the unattainable fruit.
