Today we had breakfast at Howe Hall where we’d be doing most of our group work. I was surprised at how far the campus looked from our apartments on the map but the walk to campus was so lovely. We passed horses in their stables, saw baby bunnies grazing, and chipmunks dashing from one tree to another. It only took around 10 minutes to and from the school.

We went to get our student ID cards sorted and they needed a current ID card from us. I pulled out my drivers licence all proud only to find that it was expired since January 2019. That was a bummer.

Having lunch at the Union Drive Marketplace was so cool. I was spoilt for choice but because it was a buffet, I got to have a bit of everything! Soft serve on demand was the cherry on top! Knowing I have access to this isn’t good for my waistline….
