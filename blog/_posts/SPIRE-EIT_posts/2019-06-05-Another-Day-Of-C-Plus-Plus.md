Help Iâ€™m struggling with Fibonnaci sequence and I canâ€™t get up. I had worked on this formula a while back Iâ€™m going to have to practice a lot tonight to feel comfortable with it. I tend to overthink problems and gotta learn to write out each step of what Iâ€™m trying to do. Well if thereâ€™s any time to walk in uncharted territory its now and Iâ€™m glad.

For lunch I got to try Jeffâ€™s pizza with Kelsey and Nina. I was quite skeptical of the quality since it was only 5 bucks for two slices but to my surprise it was really good! Its been a while since I had such good pizza. On the way back to campus we saw the student dorms and their cute names for each floor. I could see myself in one of them ðŸ˜‰
