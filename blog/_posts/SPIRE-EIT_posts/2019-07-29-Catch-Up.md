Sorry for the hiatus! Its been a whirlwind past few days. From travelling to Minneapolis to present our project at the University of Minnesota, to working on our research paper and poster. Not to mention the crazy UNO game nights we’ve been having at the dorms.

Its the last week of our program and I’m feeling all sorts of weird emotions. On the one hand I can’t wait to be back in Chicago with my loved ones, on the other I don’t want to leave the friends I’ve made here. I’m not gonna cry. Got to focus on our research paper and poster!
