You know how I recovered from a cold in my previous post?
Welp I got bitten by a literal bug. A horsefly to be precise.
I went for a run with Roselynn as the host,
where a bug locked onto my calf like a vice.

The next few days my leg swelled up like a balloon
which didn’t seem normal to me
I guess from bug bites I wasn’t immune
and shouldn’t have let that bug go free.

The team at VRAC were so helpful. They took me to urgent care twice to make sure I was OK. Thanks to Eliot, Abby, Andrew and Tiffany for all the help, I really appreciate it!

Aside from that, I’ve been learning so much. I worked with Tiger over the weekend on partitioning binary data. I was afraid that completing the application wasn’t going to leave a lasting impression on my understanding of the material. Tiger helped me by drawing out the problem and I got past the stage of being unassertive and asked more questions. We got it done and I was so happy on how we worked as a team.

Our luncheon lecture with Jon Kelly really resonated with me. I enjoyed his talk on his journey in obtaining a psychology degree but didn’t want to become a psychologist as this would pertain to theoretical papers as opposed to applied research. These luncheon lectures make me question my current goals as a graduate student. They’re all so interesting, I wish I could study all of these fields.
