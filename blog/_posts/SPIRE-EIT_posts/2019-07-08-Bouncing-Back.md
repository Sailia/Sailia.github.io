This past week was quite frustrating. I was a walking ball of phlegm for a week, my computer was so slow to the point of opening a file would take half an hour, I couldn’t log in to the Spire-EIT site at my dorm so I couldn’t do my Gendermag assignment, I couldn’t work from home on the shaders assignment because my laptop is rubbish when it comes to game engines, it rained most of the time, I missed some cool discussions at the HCI and Ethics classes and I all in all felt really useless towards my team.

BUT! After many sleep marathons, I finally started to feel better since Friday morning. I rode my bike for nearly 6 miles, following a bike path and not knowing where I’d end up. Paul Easker replaced my PC with another (Thanks Paul!) and Alex Renner gave me good advice on learning better. I think he’d be a great professor.

I’ve basically been stuck on my shaders project for the past three days. Things I’ve tried:

    Downloading over 4 grass packages to find that they don’t work with the version of Unity I have.
    Tried making my own grass using a tutorial. I created a terrain with many vertices. When I tried implementing grass on to the terrain my computer shut down and I lost everything.
    Read a bunch of forums on how to effectively make grass.

I gave in and used a grass asset that you can paint with in Unity. I will figure this out when I try making my own game in Unity later down the line.
