We got up bright and early to drive to the Iowa Valley Adventures Challenge Course. I was thinking of all worst case scenarios whilst driving to the course. When we got there we were informed that if anyone were to use the bathrooms in the building near the course we’d need to be mindful of the democratic event being held as Bernie Sanders was giving a speech o_o. It was a nice distraction from the actual course that could end my life….

Watching each team member get hoisted up on the ropes by the strength of our 10 research students was awesome. We all worked together to lift one person, which was a nice thought.

As I watched as each person drop and swing on the ropes, I decided that if I’m going to do this, I will give it my all. I let the team hoist me to the highest point and let go. IT WAS AWESOME! I definitely want to do this again. It also removed any fears for rock climbing which is something I always wanted to do. I have to try this out at the state gym.
