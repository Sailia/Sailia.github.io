Today was our last day with Unity. I was too excited for selecting our deeper dives I kept wondering what was next in store for us. Probably because I got into the habit of moving on to the next topic after each crash course. I’m glad we’ll be able to spend more time on our chosen “dive”? My first choice was GPU Programming, more specifically Unity Shaders, second choice was 3D Printing and third was VR development. I got Unity Shaders! Excited!
