Today we dived into Unity shaders. There’s a lot tools to familiarise myself with but its all very interesting. One thing I need to fully understand are the Vector functions. Other than that I’m quite excited to learn more about how the graphics processor works as well as the shaders language that’s used in Visual Studio. We learned that shaders is its own language separate from C#. It kind of reminds me of gems in Ruby. Based on whats being taught right now, I think Unity is a very user friendly learning tool.

Vijay took us under his wing and taught us so much in just one session. I like that he makes sure we all understand before moving on so I’m glad to have picked this deeper dive. It was nice to get to know Vijay and his journey to Iowa State. He wasn’t able to explain much but I’ll pry some more later. I learned a lot about plaster from him too!
