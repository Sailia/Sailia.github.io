We had a luncheon with Professor Rick Stone and became very inspired with his life story. He has done so much in his life! He does research in human performance enhancement in both physical and mental domains. He is a certified welder, a sheriffs deputy, commercial diver… The list just goes on! I’m interested in working in data science for the military specifically in Intelligence. Hearing that Professor Stone worked with the military to produce “An Upper Body Exoskeleton for Firearm Training” moved me.

As for the parsing binary files in C++, IT WORKS! I wanted to revise the code so I asked the talented staff at VRAC to spare some time to view our work and hear their take on it. I’m very grateful to be an intern at VRAC, everyone is so helpful and generous. I will try to absorb all that I can! 😀
