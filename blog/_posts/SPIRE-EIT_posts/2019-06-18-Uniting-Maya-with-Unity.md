Today we imported our scene project from Maya into Unity. I think Unity is quite similar to Maya in terms of design tools but allows for easier rendering for gaming applications. Learning how to use Unity wasn’t as difficult as I thought. I realised I like C# more than C++ as the documentation for it is really easy to understand 😀 I want to make a side scroller game as my first project and after our tutorial its made me feel less overwhelmed in implementing it.

Did I mention I love riding my bike? Its been years since I’ve ridden one and doing so here reminded me how awesome it is. My legs are getting stronger and feel healthier! Contemplating on whether to buy one once I head back to Chicago but there are just too many potholes and mean drivers around….

I need to start thinking about questions to ask my mentors regarding our research paper as I’ll be working on creating a poster tomorrow. ✌️
