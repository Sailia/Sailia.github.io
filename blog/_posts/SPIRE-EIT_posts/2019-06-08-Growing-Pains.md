We went over more inheritance and object oriented programming in C++. I still feel quite behind in learning the syntax of C++ and this is something I need to understand for our Ballistics project. Understanding the use of a header file amongst other things is going over my head. I took Programming I in Java and thought this was sufficient to learn in the program. But hearing Bradon, Kelsey and Tiger explain their take on C++ helped. Thanks ya’ll! I’ll continue to learn how to utilise this program over the weekend. Thanks to Adam Kohl in trying to get me to understand C++ also.

I want to bring these C++ files on to my laptop using Xcode and Alex told me about CMake which is a simple platform and compiler that generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of choice. Its so cool!

Gotta learn to focus on one thing at a time!
